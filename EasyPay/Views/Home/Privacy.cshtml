                    the requirements of multiple countries or jurisdictions. While there is no universal
                    guidance for the content of specific privacy policies, a number of organizations
                    provide example forms</p>

                    A disclaimer may specify mutually-agreed and privately-arranged terms and conditions
                    as part of a contract; or may specify warnings or expectations to the general public

                    unreasonable risk of harm or injury. Some disclaimers are intended to limit exposure
                    to damages after harm or injury has already been suffered. Additionally, some kinds
